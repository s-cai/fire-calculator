# AI-Assisted Development Guidelines

This repository is primarily generated by AI under close human supervision.

## Documentation Requirements

### README.md - Living Status Document
- The README tracks the **current status** of the project (not a changelog)
- Update the README whenever something meaningful changes
- Include: project purpose, current features, setup instructions, known limitations

### plans/ Directory - Complicated Changes
Before implementing any non-trivial change, create a plan document in `plans/`:

**Filename format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

**Required sections:**
1. **Starting Point** - Current commit hash and branch
2. **Context** - Why this change is needed, background information
3. **Code to Review** - Files and sections that must be read/understood first
4. **Plan of Change** - Step-by-step implementation approach
5. **Testing Plan** - How to verify the change works correctly
6. **Rollback Strategy** - How to undo if something goes wrong

## When to Create a Plan

Create a plan for changes that:
- Touch 3+ files
- Add new features or capabilities
- Refactor existing architecture
- Integrate external dependencies
- Could break existing functionality

Skip plans for:
- Simple bug fixes
- Documentation-only updates
- Formatting/style changes
- Single-file, isolated changes
